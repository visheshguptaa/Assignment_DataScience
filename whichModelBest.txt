Model Comparison ->


1. Logistic Regression:

Pros: Easy to interpret, fast to train, and performs reasonably well in detecting fraudulent transactions.
Cons: Has lower recall and precision compared to tree-based models. It assumes a linear relationship between features and the target variable.
Use Case: Suitable for cases where interpretability is important, but may not be ideal for highly imbalanced or complex datasets.

2. Random Forest:

Pros: Performs significantly better than Logistic Regression with higher precision and recall.
Cons: Slower to train and predict compared to Logistic Regression, especially with large datasets.
Use Case: A good balance between performance and interpretability. Suitable for datasets with non-linear relationships and some level of complexity.

3. XGBoost:

Pros: The best performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC. XGBoost is highly efficient and can handle class imbalance and complex data patterns.
Cons: Slightly more complex to tune, but with techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV, it can be optimized effectively.
Use Case: The best choice when maximum performance is needed, especially for highly imbalanced datasets like fraud detection.


Conclusion ->
Which Model is More Suitable?


XGBoost is the most suitable model for detecting fraudulent transactions:

1. It has the highest AUC-ROC, indicating it is excellent at distinguishing between fraud and legitimate transactions.
2. Its high recall makes it effective at minimizing the number of missed fraud cases.
3. While slightly more complex to tune, its performance gains make it the most reliable option in this case.
4. Random Forest is a close second and might be chosen if interpretability is important, or if training time is a factor.
