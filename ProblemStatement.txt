Data Science Assignment : Fraud Detection

Problem Statement: Credit Card Transaction Fraud Detection

You are provided with a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing both
legitimate and fraudulent transactions. The dataset spans a duration of two years,
covering transactions made between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2020. It includes
records for 1000 customers performing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.
The task is to build a model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions based on
the available transaction data. The challenge involves understanding the transaction
patterns of legitimate and fraudulent behavior and applying machine learning
techniques to classify future transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.
Dataset Information

● The dataset contains multiple features related to the transaction (e.g., transaction
amount, merchant, customer demographics, and transaction category).
● The data has been generated using a simulation tool that applies various profiles
(e.g., demographic and geographical characteristics) to create realistic customer
transaction behavior.
● Each transaction is labeled as either "fraud" or "legitimate."
Assignment Task ->

1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
○ Perform a detailed analysis of the dataset to understand the distribution of
features, identify missing or anomalous values, and detect patterns that
may indicate fraud.
○ Visualize key insights from the data, such as the distribution of
transaction amounts, time-based patterns, and fraud detection rates.

2. Data Preprocessing:
○ Handle any missing or inconsistent data.
○ Apply appropriate feature engineering techniques to improve model
performance (e.g., deriving new features or aggregating information).

3. Model Building:
○ Implement various machine learning models (e.g., logistic regression,
decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, or deep learning
techniques) to predict fraudulent transactions.
○ Tune the models to optimize performance using appropriate metrics (e.g.,
accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC).

4. Evaluation and Conclusion:
○ Evaluate model performance on a test dataset.
○ Compare the performance of different models and discuss which model is
more suitable for detecting fraudulent transactions and why.
